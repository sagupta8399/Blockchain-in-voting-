#idea for codefundo++

The basic problem in current voting system through electronic voting machines is the lack of transparency and high risk of the hardware or software of the machines to be tampered.So with the use of blockchain we can minimize these problems and make our voting system very good.
The idea is to make the voting online,on the voting booths only the voting site could be opened.
In the backend there will be a blockchain system,with every vote a block is created and added to the system.The blockchain uses the hashing system so hash should be in such a way that person's identity can not be traced in any way.
Once person casts the vote,a block is formed by information of that.
Now there will be blocks of candidates also,once a person caste vote for a particular candidate the block of vote is connected to the candidate, it can be assumed to be as a transaction of a vote from voter to candidate.
now on the day of counting only we will give access to the candidate blocks so in this way there is no way tampering can happen in the process and the voting process will become much more efficient and safer.
